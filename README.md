# BDS-project
 Twitter API project Big Data Science course University of Ghent, 2020

## Research question
 Did the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Belgium have an observable influence on the tweeting behaviour in Flanders?
## Folder structure
 /data 			-> all raw data gathered from twitter and all further processed data (e.g. from the notebooks in '/data exploration' used for visualisation in the dashboard)
 /data exploration 	-> 2 logically consecutive notebooks in which the raw sentiment data from '/data' is explored and various visualisations are made based on intuition to find an answer for our research question
 /demo 			-> the final step of the project in which the processed sentiment data is presented in conjunction with gathered COVID-19 statistics
 /papers 		-> contains a research paper on which our approach to add the translation step to english for sentiment analysis was grounded
 /sentiment_analysis	-> multiple .py files containing all code used to do the sentiment analysis. 
 /requirements.txt 	-> all dependencies necessary for execution of the python code used in this project
